Messiah App is going to attend Oasis 500 Bootcamp in Amman and we're really excited for this opportunity. We look forward to represent Pakistan on the largest tech initiative in the Middle East. Download the app now and be a part of our community to make this Civic App a great success. We're also thankful to Code for Pakistan for providing us a great number of opportunities while being a part of their great Fellowship program, it was a great journey indeed.

A city like Peshawar ends up in world news daily, mostly because of the terror threats and challenges it faces. But its irrepressible citizens find hope in other areas of progress. They rise to most challenges and resiliently look forward to doing more. We'd be reviving the name of our city.
